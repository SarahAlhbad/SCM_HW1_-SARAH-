 Importance of Software Configuration Management
Software Configuration Management (SCM) is essential for controlling the versions of software and tracking changes in projects to ensure consistency and integrity.  

Benefits of SCM include:
- Reducing errors caused by overlapping changes.
- Enhancing collaboration between different teams.
- Making it easier to revert to previous versions when needed.
- Ensuring clear and well-organized documentation of changes.
